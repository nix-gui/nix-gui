* Nix-Gui
Make NixOS usable for non-technical users through a settings / package management GUI.

[[screenshots/historical_2021_06_23.gif]]


** Motives
The declarative nature of NixOS provides it the capability of being *the most user friendly linux distro.* No more [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][editing dotfiles]], =/etc= files, manually writing timers, services, running commands to manage and create users and groups, etc. NixOS integrates all of that into a declarative system, and this project integrates NixOS' declarative system into a GUI.

*** Serve Users Unfamiliar with or Learning Nix
Nix-Gui is a configuration management tool designed for those who haven't mastered the (arguably difficult) nix language. It is also an attempt to replicate the ease of use of popular configuration systems including
- Ubuntu's Unity System Settings
- Mint's Cinnimon Settings
- Synaptic Package Manager

Nix-Gui is designed to gradually and comfortably teach users about the mechanics of the nix language and nixpkgs.

*** Serve as an Effective System Management Tool for Experienced Users
At the most advanced level, and once feature parity has been achieved. Power users should be capable of changing system configuration, creating system ISOs, [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixops][deploying systems to the cloud]], etc in Nix-Gui more intelligibly and faster than through their traditional means of writing a nix module.

*** Serve Mobile Users
An additional motive for this project is to enable system configuration for [[https://mobile.nixos.org/][mobile devices]] without having to type code on your phone.
