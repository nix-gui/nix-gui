* Nix-Gui
Make nixos usable for non-technical users through a settings / package management GUI.

[[screenshots/historical_2021_06_23.gif]]


** Motives
The declarative nature of nixos provides it the capability of being *the most user friendly linux distro.* No more [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][editing dotfiles]], =/etc= files, manually writing timers, services, running commands to manage and create users and groups, etc. Nixos integrates all of that into a declarative system, and this project integrates nixos' declarative system into a GUI.

*** Serve Users Unfamiliar with, or Learning Nix
Nix-Gui is a configuration management tool designed for those who haven't mastered the (arguably difficult) nix language. It is also an attempt to replicate the ease of use of popular configuration systems including
- Ubuntu's Unity System Settings
- Mint's Cinnimon Settings
- Synaptic Package Manager

At the same time, Nix-Gui should serve to gradually and comfortably teach users about the mechanics of the nix language and nixpkgs. At the most advanced level, once feature parity has been achieved Nix-Gui may be considered an IDE.

*** Serve Mobile Users
An additional motive for this project is to enable system configuration for [[https://mobile.nixos.org/][mobile devices]] without having to type code on your phone.
